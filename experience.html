                    <h2>Ministry of Cooperation (Dec 2022 - Feb 2023)</h2>
                    <p> I worked as a Data Analyst Intern under the guidance of a 
                        District Cooperative Officer for 3 months where I assigned two department data, 
                        Cooperative dept data and the Animal & Fishery dept data. So, I have to analyze
                        the data and then explore and visualize the data. I need to perform exploratory 
                        data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the data. I use statistical 
                        techniques and visualization tools to identify patterns, correlations, and 
                        outliers. Visualizations, such as charts, graphs and created dashboards using 
                        PowerBI to present the findings effectively. And finally I have to submit the 
                        report to the DCO.
                    </p>   
                    <h2>Qedge Tech (July 2022 - Nov 2022)</h2>
                    <p> I worked as a Python Backend Developer Intern for 4 months where I used Python 
                        for backend development, either through web frameworks or custom server-side code.
                        I have to work on building APIs, implementing business logic, handling data 
                        persistence, and optimizing performance.

                    </p>
                    <h2>Kaashiv Infotech (March 2023 - June 2023)</h2>
                    <p> I worked as a Data Analyst Intern for 4 months where I had to collect data from 
                        various sources, such as databases, APIs, or external data providers. I got data 
                        like previous year diwali sales,  from many stakeholders and I had to analyze, 
                        explore and visualize it with the help of EDA for a better understanding and 
                        create a dashboard and report that shows top selling products, top gaining 
                        margin products, top buying age groups, least selling product, etc. So, the 
                        company ensures next time what product they have to keep in large amounts and 
                        what product they have to keep in less amount.
